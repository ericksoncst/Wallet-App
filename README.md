Sorry about that animations üòÇüòÇ


## Final toughts:

- Why react-query: 
RQ provides me more control and performance do menage my api calls aand I can use it as state-menager.

- Why Typescript:
It's not my confort zone.

- Why Jest:
My knowledge doesn't not cover tests. So I tried to do my best. I lost a lot of time trying other libs...

- About animations:
Same as previous topic üòÇ

- What I miss?

I need to fix loadings order.
Theme of the app.
The flat list style. (SHAME).
Put types in a unique file.
Adjust Fonts.
Type my tests.
Create a custom https handler.
